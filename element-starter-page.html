<!-- what about the shiv? 

The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.

Manual installation

Download and extract the latest zip package from this repositiory and copy the two files dist/html5shiv.js and dist/html5shiv-printshiv.js into your project. Then include one of them into your <head> as above. 

but it's on google, see below, so...

<!--James Williamson says: "After the title tag, add the HTML5 shiv script link. It just tells IE to create these elements. It's very short. You can copy this and host it yourself. This is just for less than IE 9, so it doesn't make sense to have others load it." 
So this shiv probably needs to move up above the css.

Respond.js
A fast & lightweight polyfill for min/max-width CSS3 Media Queries (for IE 6-8, and more)

    Copyright 2011: Scott Jehl, scottjehl.com
    Licensed under the MIT license.

The goal of this script is to provide a fast and lightweight (3kb minified / 1kb gzipped) script to enable responsive web designs in browsers that don't support CSS3 Media Queries - in particular, Internet Explorer 8 and under. It's written in such a way that it will probably patch support for other non-supporting browsers as well (more information on that soon).


Usage Instructions

   1.  Craft your CSS with min/max-width media queries to adapt your layout from mobile (first) all the way up to desktop

    @media screen and (min-width: 480px){
        ...styles for 480px and up go here
    }

    2. Reference the respond.min.js script (1kb min/gzipped) after all of your CSS (the earlier it runs, the greater chance IE users will not see a flash of un-media'd content)

    3. Crack open Internet Explorer and pump fists in delight
