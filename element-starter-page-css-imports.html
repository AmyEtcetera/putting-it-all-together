<!-- what about the shiv? 

The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x. It's on google, see below...

Respond.js
A fast & lightweight polyfill for min/max-width CSS3 Media Queries (for IE 6-8, and more)

    Copyright 2011: Scott Jehl, scottjehl.com
    Licensed under the MIT license.

The goal of this script is to provide a fast and lightweight (3kb minified / 1kb gzipped) script to enable responsive web designs in browsers that don't support CSS3 Media Queries - in particular, Internet Explorer 8 and under. It's written in such a way that it will probably patch support for other non-supporting browsers as well (more information on that soon).


Usage Instructions

   1.  Craft your CSS with min/max-width media queries to adapt your layout from mobile (first) all the way up to desktop

    @media screen and (min-width: 480px){
        ...styles for 480px and up go here
    }

    2. Reference the respond.min.js script (1kb min/gzipped) after all of your CSS (the earlier it runs, the greater chance IE users will not see a flash of un-media'd content)

    3. Crack open Internet Explorer and pump fists in delight
