Responsive HTML5 - Core Project Elements

##What is this?
I'm putting together my files for testing to resolve core elements to use for future templates, while also kicking the tires of github to learn whether it will be useful to upcoming projects, or just another chore. And to work out thoughts on minimizing http requests.

##What will be included?
First, a basic responsive, accessible HTML5 testing page, with as many elements as I can think of that will be useful in assessing and standardizing CSS and javascript files.

###Key players:

- mobile first
- collapsing menu, starting out with Erick Arbe simple-toggle
- HTML5 shiv
- respond.js
- CSS reset is normalize.css, possibly modified at some point
- image polyfill?
- maybe modernizr
- jQuery tests
- video tests
- some ARIA

##What won't be included?
Probably everything that would be innovative or interesting to anyone but myself. LOL, but it's true.

But I am gonna leave this markdown cheatsheet link [right here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
