<!-- what about the shiv? 

The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5 styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.

Manual installation -s
Download and extract the latest zip package from this repositiory and copy the two files dist/html5shiv.js and dist/html5shiv-printshiv.js into your project. Then include one of them into your <head> as above.

Respond.js
A fast & lightweight polyfill for min/max-width CSS3 Media Queries (for IE 6-8, and more)

    Copyright 2011: Scott Jehl, scottjehl.com
    Licensed under the MIT license.

The goal of this script is to provide a fast and lightweight (3kb minified / 1kb gzipped) script to enable responsive web designs in browsers that don't support CSS3 Media Queries - in particular, Internet Explorer 8 and under. It's written in such a way that it will probably patch support for other non-supporting browsers as well (more information on that soon).


Usage Instructions

   1.  Craft your CSS with min/max-width media queries to adapt your layout from mobile (first) all the way up to desktop

    @media screen and (min-width: 480px){
        ...styles for 480px and up go here
    }

    2. Reference the respond.min.js script (1kb min/gzipped) after all of your CSS (the earlier it runs, the greater chance IE users will not see a flash of un-media'd content)

    3. Crack open Internet Explorer and pump fists in delight

<!-- This page is meant to have as many typical page elements as possible. It can be used to test CSS variations, frameworks, etc. -->
<h1>Heading Level 1 (could say what framework it is for here)</h1>

<p>** This page starts off with normalize.css as a base. I'm thinking what i want to do is add a second style sheet for some things to test. And then swap in other stylesheets. Will probably abandon the page without normalize once this one seems 'proven'. **</p>

<p>Paragraph. Add greeking.</p>
<p>Put some CSS up top, for heavens sake. Then try some other CSS.</p>

<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<p>Paragraph following level 2 heading. How is the spacing? What is done with CSS as far as margin collapse?</p>

<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<p>Paragraph. Add greeking.</p>

<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<p>Paragraph. Add greeking.</p>
